The Advanced Userrights extension adds extra functionality to MediaWiki for managing group memberships and viewing information about users.

==Features==
* Sortable list of users.
* Intuitive group membership management.
* IP-logging of registered users.

==Installation==
Place the contents of this directory in the extensions/AdvancedUserrights/-directory of your MediaWiki installation.
Navigate to your MediaWiki root directory and apply the patch:
    patch -p0 extensions/AdvancedUserrights/UserInformation.patch
Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php:
    require_once ("$IP/extensions/AdvancedUserrights/AdvancedUserrights.php");

==Settings==
Advanced Userrights has the following configurable settings:

$auEnableCheckIP = bool (default = false)
	If set to true, this will log the IP-address of every registered user 
	that visits your wiki, and it will also record the last time that the 
	user visited from that IP-address.
	NOTE: This setting needs to be set before the require_once statement.
